* Limestone Issues

- Should we include DAV:owner in PROPFIND-propname, 
  required by DAVExplorer for principal-match REPORT ?
- PUT with Digest Authentication problem in Slide Client
    1. Slide initially sends 'contents' of file using basic auth
    2. server returns 401
    3. Slide sends Digest Auth headers but does not resend the data
- 403 vs 412
  Move resource to self!
- No WebDAV client with binds support

------------------------ 

* TODOs for LimeStone

- Modularize build_vpr_hash. 
- Fix getcontentlanguage.
- Separate the report functions into a new file from version.c & acl.c
- change functions to use char *user instead of passing rec
- Pass the dav_err generated in dav_is_allow_method_* to dav_method_*
- add another member to dav_repos_resource - 'getlastmodified'. separating DAV:getlastmodified from updated_at of the body

-------------------------

* TODOs for Locks

- adding of depth infinity locks is done one child at a time. try and optimize

-------------------------

* TODOs for versioning

- allow vhrs to contain multiple vcrs
- deleting VHRs of VCCs that are circularly dependent on each other

-------------------------

* Things we would like to do but are too much of an effort

- change dbms layer functions to return dav_error instead of int  
- Think about moving from dbms_api to apr_dbd ( instead of wrapping it )
- bridge layer gets calls with dav_repos_db, which can be done away with and handled in the dbms layer itself
- reorganise limestone code into specific folders ( dbms/ , bridge/, etc. ) so that files are easire to find/manage and don't clutter the root folder.
